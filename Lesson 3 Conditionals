Directions:
Write a series of conditional statements that:

Prints "not a group" if musicians is less than or equal to 0
Prints "solo" if musicians is equal to 1

Prints "quartet" if musicians is equal to 4

 * Programming Quiz: Musical Groups (3-3)
 */

// change the value of `musicians` to test your conditional statements
var musicians = 10;

// your code goes here
if (musicians === 1) {
    console.log("solo");
}
else if (musicians === 2) {
    console.log("duet");
}
else if (musicians === 3) {
    console.log("trio");
}
else if (musicians === 4) {
    console.log("quartet");
}
else if (musicians > 4) {
    console.log("this is a large group");
}
else {
    console.log("not a group");
}

//this is a large group
