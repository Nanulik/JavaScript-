Directions:
Write a series of conditional statements that:

Prints "not a group" if musicians is less than or equal to 0
Prints "solo" if musicians is equal to 1
Prints "duet" if musicians is equal to 2
Prints "trio" if musicians is equal to 3
Prints "quartet" if musicians is equal to 4
Prints "this is a large group" if musicians is greater than 4

// change the value of `musicians` to test your conditional statements
var musicians = 10;

// your code goes here
if (musicians === 1) {
    console.log("solo");
}

    console.log("duet");
}
else if (musicians === 3) {

    console.log("this is a large group");

Quiz: Murder Mystery (3-4)

four rooms: the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, and dining room,
four weapons: poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife,
and four suspects: Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr. Kalehoff.
We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...

the poison belongs to the ballroom,
the trophy belongs to the gallery,
the pool stick belongs to the billiards room,
and the knife belongs to the dining room.
And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.

Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.
To help solve this mystery, write a combination of conditional statements that:

sets the value of weapon based on the room and
sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room
Afterwards, use this template to print a message to the console if the mystery was solved:

__________ did it in the __________ with the __________!
What goes into the three blank spaces? You can fill in the blanks with the name of the suspect, the room, and the weapon! For example, an output string may look like:

Mr. Parkes did it in the dining room with the knife!
Be sure to watch out for any extra or missing characters (including spaces and punctuation marks) in your output string as well!

TIP: Test your code with different values. For example,

If room equals gallery and suspect equals Ms. Van Cleve, then Ms. Van Cleve did it in the gallery with the trophy! should be printed to the console.

Your Code:

/*

// change the value of `room` and `suspect` to test your code
var room = "ballroom";
var suspect = "Mr. Kalehoff";

var weapon = "";

    weapon = "poison";
    solved = true;
    
} else if (room ==="gallery" &&  suspect === "Ms. Van Cleve") {
    weapon = "trophy";
    solved = true;

    solved = true;
    
} else if (room ==="dining room" &&  suspect === "Mr. Parkes") {
    weapon = "knife";
    solved = true; 
}

if (solved) {
	console.log(suspect + " did it in the " + room + " with the " + weapon + "!");
}
